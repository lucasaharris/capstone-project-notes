# Project Tech-Stack Selection
- Amazon Web Service (AWS)
    - https://aws.amazon.com/
    - AWS is selected because the client uses it to sync all of their online data, which we will need to do for the caregivers once they connect to the internet.
- React Native
    - https://reactjs.org/
    - React is selected because the client has been using it for their web app already, and they want the offline web app to be built using the same frameworks.
- Ruby on Rails
    - https://rubyonrails.org/
    - Ruby on Rails is selected because the client has been using it for their web app already, and they want the offline web app to be built using the same frameworks.
## Our Preferred Tech-Stack
- React
    - We prefer React because some of our team members already have experience with React, and React is more widely used, so the experience will translate better than Ruby on Rails.
        - Using a front-end framework is fine for our application because it will be used offline, and the back-end development has already been done by our client's in-house software engineers.
