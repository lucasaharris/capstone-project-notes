## Topics Discussed
- last iteration feedback
  - client happy with our progress, only feedback was to add the multiple in progress visits feature
  - integration testing: need to test entire flow of the offline together
- multiple in progress visits feature: structure multiple in progress visits in offline ui similar to how they do in online version
- documentation: start taking screenshots/videos of the online to offline flow so it is ready when we turn the project over to client  


## Things Clarified
- cancel visit feature: found out that only admins have this option so we don't need to implement it for the caregivers
