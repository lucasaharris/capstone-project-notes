## Topics Discussed

* Project Process
  * working in one month iterations
* Company Information
  * agency management company
  * agencies employ home healthcare workers
  * healthcare workers use DocuMentor web app to clock in and out, track schedules, and document visit information (tasks)
  * DocuMentor is not utilized for charting purposes
* Why offline DocuMentor app is needed
  * some caregivers work in rural areas where there is no service
  * currently, when caregivers aren't able to clock in/out and document their visit, they have to call and relay all of this information to their agency
* Operating Environment
  * a mobile app (IOS and Android) is preferred but client is open to an offline web app if it is more efficient
  * most customers use their personal devices
* Tech Stack
  * client prefers us to use same tech stack the company is currently using (Ruby on Rails, React Native) but is open to alternatives
  * AWS
* Flow of the web app from user perspective (recorded)
  * client will give us access to a DocuMentor test account so that we can follow the flow of the app ourselves
* Requirement Prioritization
  * client did not have preference of which features should be implemented in first release
* Clarifications
  * caregivers should be able to clock in/out even if they are not in "proper" location
    * their geolocation is recorded, and agencies handle this information externally
  * the offline app does not need to implement admin capabilities (only caregiver capabilities)
  * mobile/offline web app should look just like their current web app (same UI design)
* Communication 
  *  email and slack

## Things Clarified
* client is working on giving us access to company github, slack channel, and aws account
