## Topics Discussed

  - Need to get services dynamically.
  - Edge Cases:
    - #1 Cannot clock out offline after clocking in online.
    - #2 When caching, store the current timestamp so that when the user is offline it is displayed so that the user knows how-up-to date their data is.
    - #3 If they go offline and while offline the client list, tasks, or services is updated we need a way to let the user enter in that information manually.
