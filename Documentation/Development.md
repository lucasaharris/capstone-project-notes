# Linting
* Steps for linting Ruby code:
  * install rubocop gem: `gem install rubocop`
  * to lint the project simply type `rubocop` in your terminal
    * you should see a list of violations as output
  * to automatically correct the offenses run `bundle exec rubocop --autocorrect`
* Steps for linting JavaScript code:
  * To get started, run the following command in the terminal to install ESLint as a dev dependency:
    * `npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-config-airbnb`
  * Then initialize ESLint.
    * `npx eslint --init`
  * Youâ€™ll be prompted with questions about your project. When prompted with:
    * `? How would you like to use EsLint?`
  * Select this option:
    * `To check syntax, find problems and enforce code style`
  * Answer the next questions as per your project until you come across the following prompt.
    * `? How would you like to define a style for your project?`
  * Answer:
    * `Use a popular style guide`
  * Select the Airbnb style guide for the next prompt.
    * `<? Which style guide do you want to follow? \n > Airbnb: <https://github.com/airbnb/javascript>`
  * Lastly select "Yes" to install the required dependencies.
  * There should now be a .eslintrn.json file in the root of the folder.
  * To run the linter on a js file use:
    * `npx eslint [relative path to file]\file.js`
* To lint embeded JavaScript in an html file simply add the following to your .eslintrn.json file:
  * `plugins: [
    "html"
  ]`
  * To run the linter on an html file with embeded js use:
    * `npx eslint [relative path to file]\file.html`
 
# Environment Setup

## Replicating via Docker

   ## Set up PostgreSQL db

  ## Troubleshooting
  * After following environment set up: 
    * (Windows Specific) If you encounter an "Invalid URI" error when trying to run `ruby bin/setup`, run the following commands one after the other             instead of running `ruby bin/setup`: 
      * `ruby bin/rails db:prepare` 
      * `ruby bin/rails log:clear tmp:clear` 
      * `ruby bin/rails restart` 
     * If you encounter a Webpacker compilation error, check your version of Node (`node --version`). If you have node version 17 or above, downgrade your      version to 16.18.0
     * env file issue: If you are using DocuMentor's .env file (need permission, not provided in our repo) and you recieve a "Invalid password for                user..." error, ensure that you have created a role in postgres with DocuMentor's exact 'RDS_USERNAME', 'RDS_PASSWORD', and 'RDS_DB_NAME'. 
       See the following postgres commands for guidance: 
          * `CREATE ROLE <RDS_USERNAME> SUPERUSER LOGIN PASSWORD <RDS_PASSWORD>;`
          * `GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE <RDS_DB_NAME> TO ROLE <RDS_USERNAME>;`
   * When trying to log in to DocuMentor's login page:
       * if username 'employee1@example.com' and password 'password' do not work and you are given a "Invalid Email or password" message, run the                  following commands in your project's terminal and then try to log in again:
            * `rails db:seed`
            * `rails db:prime`'
   
  
  # Tests
  * to javascript run tests: `yarn test`
     * to run tests for a specific file: `yarn test <file name>`
     * add `--coverage` to generate a coverage report
  * to run ruby tests: `rspec <file name>`
