## Topics Discussed
- 1st iteration features
  - new design for offline page
  - clock in/out stored locally
  - still need to write data to external file
- Feedback: 
  - overall first iteration looks good
  - look through their files to see if they have style sheets already defined in order to keep design consistent and not rewrite code
  - ideas to implement for next iteration: alert user when going into offline mode, implement a listener that checks for network connection (when network       is back give user option to switch back to online mode), implement a timer so users know how long they have been clocked in for 

## Things Clarified
- reach out to client in order to clarify testing (should we use the third party testing software they are currently using or should we implement our own tests using ruby framework)
- recommends using git issue tracker for tasks for next iteration
