# Reflections

## Abby 
* Overall, the student symposium went well. I presented to a few judges as well as a few normal visitors. Some of them were non technical, so I did not go very in depth about the specific technologies we used. Instead I emphasized the business problem and our solution. Everyone I presented to seemed enthusiastic and interested in our project. Also, I got to walk around and listen to other projects from students in differnt departments which was a cool experience. 

## Alex
* I really enjoyed the symposium. I saw many students with really interesting projects and had several visitors that were genuinely interested in our project. I tried making the focus of our project about the problem presented, and how we created a solution for it instead of getting into different frameworks or other niche topics. I enjoyed having a chance to talk with people that are outside of the department, as it forced me to look at the project as more of a problem solving challange, and less of a programming assignment.
