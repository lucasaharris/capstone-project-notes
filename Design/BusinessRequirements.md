# Business Requirements

#### BR1
* DocuMentor needs to allow employees to clock in and clock out while offline. 
  * The client clearly stated to us that their biggest need for the software is that it works offline. 
  Currently, their system only allows at-home caregivers to clock in and clock out while connected to the internet. This leads to uncertainty in the number of hours employees work and payroll amounts. In order to eliminate these variables, the client would like the application to have offline capabilities.

#### BR2
* DocuMentor needs to allow employees to fill out visit documents while offline.
  * The client stated that all functionality of the webapp should be usable offline. This is a general business need that can be broken down into more specific user stories.

#### BR3
* DocuMentor should look like our online webapp so that the users are familiar with the simple design.
  * A priority for the web-app described by the client is that the design should be as close to their original website as possible. The reason behind this is they want the at-home caregivers who may not be tech savvy to be able to easily use it.

#### BR4
* DocuMentor should only permit caregiver functions, not administrator functions.
  * The client clearly stated that they only wanted this web-app to have one kind of user. The only kind of user that needs access is the at-home caregiver.
