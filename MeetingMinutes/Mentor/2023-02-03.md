## Topics Discussed

  - Evan's offline flow idea:
    - To have the clock-in section on a separate page from the clock-out section.
  - Edge case to tackle:
    - To be able to clock in online and clock out offline.
  - Communicate to the client clearly that the offline mode won't work until they log in online first. 
  - Start writing down documentation for the user to communicate quirks to the client.
  - Evan thinks it looks great for this iteration!
  - Iteration 4 features:
    - Caregiver can select multiple tasks for a visit and have they be synced back to the database.
    - Caregiver can clock in online and clock out offline.
    - Caregiver can select patient goals offline and have that synced back to the database.
    
## Things Clarified

  - Alex's path variable doesn't work for his project:
    - Evan suggests he check if he has multiple hard drives and to know where his technology is stored.
    - Or to remove libraries and redownload them.
    - Try everything. This problem could be caused by a lot of things.
