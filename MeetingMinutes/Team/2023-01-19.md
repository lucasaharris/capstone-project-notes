## Topics Discussed

- Ruby was giving us a URI ASCII error on Lucas and Alex's local copies so we worked together to find out how to fix it.  
  - We did not fix the problem by the end of the meeting. 
- Searching the API for a way to dynamically cache the services.
- We figured out how to solve a problem on Nathan's local copy where the offline data wouldn't sync.
  - The problem was Abby had not pushed her latest changes for the offline HTML.
